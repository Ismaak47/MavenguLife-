# Walkthrough - Mavengu Mobile Fix & 'Uchawi' Knowledge Upgrade

I have finalized the mobile responsiveness and implemented the new "Uchawi" (Symbolic Energy) module with strict safety guardrails.

## Major Upgrades

### 1. 'Uchawi' (Symbolic Energy) Module (New)
- **Dashboard Card**: Added a new card to the diagnosis result titled "UCHAMBUZI WA KIISHARA // SYMBOLIC ENERGY".
- **Symbolic Interpretation**: The results are generated based on the user's Life Path and are framed as internal states, fears, or challenges (e.g., "Vizuizi vya Mapenzi", "Misingi Inayoyumba").
- **Educational Chat Knowledge**: The AI chat now handles queries about witchcraft with a profound, safe, and educational approach.
- **Strict Safety Rules**: 
    - Mavengu **never** confirms if a user is bewitched.
    - Mavengu **never** creates paranoia or suspicion.
    - Mavengu uses **Quran, Bible, and Psychology** to explain the concept neutrally.
- **Mandatory 5-Step Structure for Uchawi**:
    1. **Foundational Truth**: Neutral and educational definition.
    2. **Scriptural View**: Context from Quran and Bible.
    3. **Psychological View**: Explaining how stress/fear manifest as "magic".
    4. **Symbolic Interpretation**: Linking the dashboard card to the soul's language.
    5. **Grounding Insight**: Directing the user to self-care and mental health.

### 2. Chat Toggle Fix
- **Auto-Hide Toggle**: The robot icon now disappears when the chat is active, preventing Send button obstruction on mobile.
- **Z-Index Optimization**: Improved layering for a seamless mobile experience.

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Finalization
- **Full-Screen Chat**: Optimized for mobile viewports.
- **Fluid Grids**: All dashboard cards stack correctly on small screens.

## Verification Results

### 'Uchawi' Query Test
- **Input**: "Ninaona card ya uchawi, inamaanisha nini?"
- **Response**: Mavengu explains that in symbolic systems, the card represents an internal state or fear, not a physical event. It provides context from scriptures and psychology, ensuring the user feels calm and informed.

### Safety Guardrail Test
- **Input**: "Je, nimerogwa?"
- **Response**: Mavengu avoids confirming or denying, instead explaining the psychological and cultural history of the concept and encouraging the user to focus on their internal alignment and peace.

### Mobile Layout Test
- Verified that the new "Uchawi" card fits perfectly within the responsive grid on both desktop and mobile.
